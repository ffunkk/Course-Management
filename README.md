- **Student Management**: (Enroll students, maintain records, and assign grades).
- **Faculty Management**: (Assign faculty to courses and manage their workloads).
- **Authentication System**: (Role-based access for administrators, students, and faculty).
- **Grade Management**: (Record and compute student grades).
- **Reporting System**: (Generate detailed reports on grades, class lists, and faculty loads).

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js (for a dynamic and responsive user interface).
- **Backend**: Django (to handle business logic and API development).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (to store and manage user and course data).
